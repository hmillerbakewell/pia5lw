            Guess the word!
            You get seven tries.
            The words are root words,
            meaning <em>no plurals</em> or conjugations.

            <li>
                <span class="score1">Blue</span> letter: The letter appears somewhere else in the word.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="score0">Grey</span> letter: The letter does not appear in the word.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="score3">Grey word</span>: The word is not in the word list (e.g. plurals), so this doesn't count as a guess.

            The source word list is a modification of the common word list from the Moby project.
            It contains many words that I, the author,
            had not encountered before. Good luck.
