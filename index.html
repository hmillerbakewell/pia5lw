            Guess the word!
            You get seven tries.
            The computer chooses from a list of
            five letter dictionary words.
            The words are root words,
            meaning no plurals or conjugations,
            but can include scientific terms.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="score2">Green</span> background: Right letter, right place.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="score1">Blue</span> background: The letter appears somewhere else in the word.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="score0">Grey</span> background: The letter does not appear in the word.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="score3">Grey word</span>: The word is not in the word list (e.g. plurals), so this doesn't count as a guess.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If the word isn't in the dictionary then the response
            will be shown greyed out, and it won't cost you a guess.

            The source word list is a modification of the common word list from the Moby project.
            It contains many words that I, the author,
            had not encountered before. Good luck.
